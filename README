This is the README file for 'FIIOFS'. The project website is located at:

alexanderbailey.github.io/software

'FIIOFS' is mathematical software for computing Finite (Rees) Index Ideals Of Free Semigroups. Background material, pseduo-code and justification of the algorithms can be found in the paper [arxiv.org/abs/1409.2444].

--------
Contents
--------

After extraction, the folder FIIOFS should contain the directories

  ideals
  ideals/n-2

the source code files

  next_index_ideal.cpp
  join_ideal.cpp
  parallel_join_config_ideal.cpp
  parallel_join_ideal.cpp
  get_poly_ideal.cpp
  read_file_ideal.cpp

the data files

  ideals/n-2/n-2-k-1-i-1.bit8
  ideals/n-2/n-2-k-2-i-1.bit8

the license file COPYING and this README file.

General comments
----------------

This functions in exactly the same way as 'FISOFS' except it calculates ideals instead of subsemigroups.
See the README file for 'FISOFS' for descriptions and examples of running the code.

To optimise space, the encoding of the files for ideals is slightly different than for subsemigroups, so any attempt to read subsemigroup data files instead of ideal data files will fail.

Please feel free to email me any bugs, questions or comments etc.
